## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I improved my CSS skills, I was challenged to center the card horizontally and vertically and I did it after a research and CSS rules recap.
I also learned to use the figma file better.

This is how I managed to center the card. It's a parent box design.

```css
.container {
  background-color: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
  height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

This challenge was a really good experience for me. I need to improve semantic HTML with CSS.
